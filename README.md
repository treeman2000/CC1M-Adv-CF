# CC1M-adv-C/F: Datasets for robustness evaluation

Robustness evaluation is particularly important in the field of AI, especially when deep learning and machine learning models are widely used in real-world tasks. The challenge in this field is that many models may show fragility when facing various uncertainties and perturbations. Robustness evaluation aims to quantify and improve the stability and reliability of the model in different scenarios, so as to ensure that it can cope with unforeseen input changes, adversarial attacks or data bias.
Therefore, we provide 2 robustness evaluation datasets, which are generated based on different methods, one based on classification head, called CC1M-adv-C, and the other based on features, called CC1M-adv-F. We provide supporting codes to facilitate testing of the model robustness.
